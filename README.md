This is the source code for my personal blog and portfolio website registered under the domain [https://nguyenmailinh.info](nguyenmailinh.info) hosted at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

- React framework https://nextjs.org/
- Types https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- CSS styling https://tailwindcss.com/

I follow the `Next.js` [Typescript tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/typescript) and adapt their example [blog app](https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/) to include `Tailwind CSS`.
