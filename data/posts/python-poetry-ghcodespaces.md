I am currently working as a Python Consultant Freelancer, supporting [Citizen Developers](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer) (*CDs*) at a major [European TSO company](https://www.ecc.de/en/about-ecc/partners/transmission-system-operators). The tools used by these CDs range from no-code and low-code to high-code solutions like Python.

One of the recurrent topics in my daily support work is how to set up a Poetry-managed Python project locally and replicate the same setup in a development container, such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). To address this, I have created a new public repository that summarises the necessary steps and turns them into a comprehensive guide.

If you haven't already, I invite you to explore my new guide, humorously named
[cuddly-poetry-python](https://github.com/MaiLinhGroup/cuddly-poetry-python), available on [Mai-GitHub](https://github.com/MaiLinhGroup)!
