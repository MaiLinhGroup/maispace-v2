After six years as a Software Engineer, it's frustrating not being able to
showcase my work - neither the final products nor the code I've contributed. The
latter is crucial for potential employers and clients seeking insight into my
coding skills and style. However, I've primarily worked with closed-source software,
meaning the code isn't publicly accessible, not even for personal reference after
project completion or leaving the company. The nature of the business restricts
access to the code, remaining solely with the client or employer and their licensees.
While I wish I could share some source code I'm proud of, it's neither feasible
nor legal.

Yet, with every line of code written or omitted, and each project completed, I
carry the invaluable knowledge and insights gained along the way. While code
alone showcases my coding ability, I believe it's a _necessary but not sufficient
condition_ of a Software Engineer. Instead, it's the knowledge and insights acquired
during projects that shape my CV and interviews with prospective clients and employers.

Admittedly, the absence of real-life code to back my expertise sometimes triggers
imposter syndrome. However, I recently realized I have repositories with coding
challenges from tech interviews and competitions like LeetCode, providing a glimpse
into my skills and passion for coding. While these challenges differ from my daily
work as a Software Engineer, I've chosen to share them to confront my fear of
inadequacy.

If you haven't already, I invite you to explore my
[GitHub](https://github.com/MaiLinhGroup?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=&sort=) profile,
where these repositories are now publicly accessible!
