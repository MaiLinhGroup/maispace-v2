This will be a brief post.

I was recently tasked with creating a slideshow showcasing my Python projects
and coaching approach. Going through this exercise was beneficial as it allowed
me to revisit my past projects, reflecting on the progress I've made. More
importantly, it highlighted how much more there is to learn and explore!

Here, I'm sharing these slides and intend to share
additional ones in the future, covering other aspects of my portfolio.
