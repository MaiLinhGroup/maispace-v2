❓ What sets **Freelancing** apart from **Term-to-Perm Hiring**? ❓

Consider this excerpt from a job description\*:

> This opportunity invites skilled professionals to join an exciting project with the potential for a full-time transition based on performance and mutual fit.

At first glance, the job title piqued my interest. Yet, upon delving into the details, my excitement dwindled. As a freelancer, the mention of a potential shift to full-time raises questions about the role's intended nature. If they seek a full-time employee but are uncertain about fit, wouldn't a probationary period serve this purpose? Or could they consider engaging temporary workers through employment agencies (aka ANÜ in Germany) for a trial period if they hesitate to commit long-term?

In the IT sector, many of us who chose freelancing were highly sought-after employees and remain so. We aren't former employees who fell short; rather, we're passionate freelancers by choice.
