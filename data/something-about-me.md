Moin, I am Mai Linh and I'm a freelance software engineer based in Berlin, Germany!

As a software engineer, I'm passionate about crafting digital solutions that drive innovation and make a difference. On MaiSpace, you'll get a glimpse into my world of coding, problem-solving, and the projects that have shaped my journey.

I draw inspiration for my blog from a variety of sources and don't limit it to technical topics. If you're interested in technology, creativity, or simply looking to connect for professional purposes, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maithing "in/maithing") and get in touch with me.
